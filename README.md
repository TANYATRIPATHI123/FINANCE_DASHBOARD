# Finance Dashboard with Stock Price Prediction

A finance dashboard built using React.js that showcases real-time stock data and future price predictions generated by a machine learning (ML) model. This dashboard helps users monitor stock prices and gain insights through predictions based on historical data.

## Features

- **Real-time Stock Data**: Displays the latest stock prices for various companies.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Provides future stock price predictions using an ML model.
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualizes stock price trends and predicted values using dynamic graphs.
- **Responsive UI**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in, save preferences, and customize the dashboard.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Python (for running the ML model)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finance-dashboard.git
cd finance-dashboard
```

### Install Dependencies

1. **Frontend (React)**:
 Navigate to the client directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
	 or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. **Backend (Node.js and Python)**:

	The server includes the ML model server, which can be run using Python:

	```bash
	cd server
	npm install   # Install Node.js dependencies
	```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the server (Node.js)**:
   
   To handle API requests for stock data, run the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:4000`.
  . **		Run the client (React)**:

   Finally, to start the React development server, run:

   ```bash
     cd client
   npm start
   ```

   The React app will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables
  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of both the client and server. You will need to set the following variables:

For the **client**:

```
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:[port]
```

For the **server**:

```
MONGO_URL=your_mongo_url_here
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run the following in the `client` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production files will be in the `build` directory, which can be deployed to a static site hosting platform.

## Usage

- Open the application in the browser: `http://localhost:3000`.
- Log in or sign up to create a personalized dashboard.
- Search for stock symbols to view real-time stock data and future predictions.
- Visualize stock trends and predictions using interactive charts.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js (with Hooks)
  - Material-UI for design and components
  - Chart.js or D3.js for interactive data visualization
  - Axios for API requests

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - RESTful API for stock data
  - JWT for user authentication
  - Python Flask for serving ML predictions

## To-Do List

- Implement multi-stock comparison feature
- Improve prediction accuracy by using advanced models like LSTMs
- Add more technical indicators
- Optimize API requests for faster stock data retrieval
